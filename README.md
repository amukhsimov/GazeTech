## Description
This repository contains frameworks for pre-processing, training, and evaluating full face or multi-region (face, left and right eyes) gaze estimation models on the following three datasets: ETH-XGaze, MPIIFaceGaze, and Gaze360. These frameworks allow for flexible load single-face input or multi-region input and serve to reproduce our results and benchmark new models.

The readme files in the submodules of different datasets here contain step-by-step tutorials to help you set up, train and evaluate our existing and your new models.
